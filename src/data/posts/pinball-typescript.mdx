# Pinball Prototype â€“ A Physics-Based Browser Game

- Role: Game Developer, UX Designer
- Technologies: TypeScript, Canvas/WebGL, Physics Engine (Planck.js), HTML/CSS



## Overview

This browser-based pinball prototype was my personal deep dive into real-time interaction design, physics simulation, and game feel. Inspired by classic pinball mechanics, I wanted to challenge myself with collision detection, timing, user feedback, and smooth renderingâ€”all in a lightweight, browser-native environment.

## Goals
-	Build a working physics-based pinball game using only web technologies.
-	Learn how to implement 2D physics, flipper mechanics, and collision responses.
-	Create a retro-inspired visual and audio experience.
-	Explore game UX, especially around controls and feedback.

## Features
-	ðŸŒ€ Interactive Flippers: Smooth, reactive control using keyboard or touchscreen input.
-	ðŸ§² Realistic Ball Physics: Implemented using [Planck.js] or custom force logic, including friction, gravity, and rebounds.
-	ðŸŽ¯ Scoring System: Points awarded for targets hit and combo chains.
-	ðŸŒˆ Retro Aesthetic: Pixel-inspired visuals and simple game loop for a nostalgic feel.
-	ðŸ”„ Restartable Loop: Quick reset flow for instant replayability.

## Design Process

Even though this was a technical challenge, I approached it with a UX mindset:
-	Prioritized control responsiveness and player feedbackâ€”key in pinball.
-	Made early sketches of table layouts and player flows.
-	Tuned flipper angles and ball bounces over many iterations for game feel.
-	Created a clean, uncluttered layout with vibrant color cues.



## Challenges
-	Getting the ball and flippers to interact with just the right amount of bounce and force.
-	Balancing performance with physics calculations in the browser.
-	Designing a game interface that felt retro yet responsive and modern.


## What I Learned
-	Deeper understanding of game loops, animation frames, and input handling.
-	Experience tweaking physics parameters to match desired behavior.
-	How small UX tweaks (like sound timing or visual feedback) dramatically affect game feel.
-	Reinforced the idea that even small games benefit from intentional design.

## Next Steps
-	Add more levels.
-	Explore porting it to WebAssembly for performance experiments.
-	Release as an open-source project or tutorial series on real-time browser games.

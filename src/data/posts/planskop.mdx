## Planskop ‚Äì A Minimal Habit Tracker Powered by WebAssembly

- Role: Full-Stack Developer, UX Designer
- Technologies: Next.js, Rust, WebAssembly (WASM), TypeScript

### Overview

Planskop is a minimalist habit-tracking web app designed to help users build and maintain positive routines through a clean interface and fast performance. It‚Äôs a personal project that allowed me to explore advanced frontend performance optimization with WebAssembly, while also applying my background in UX/UI design and full-stack development.

### Goals

- Build a fast, responsive, and offline-capable habit tracker.
- Practice integrating Rust with Next.js via WebAssembly.
- Design a clear and distraction-free user interface that encourages consistency.
- Ensure accessibility and cross-device compatibility.

### Key Features
-	üìÖ Recurring Habits: Supports flexible daily, weekly, or custom schedules.
-	‚öôÔ∏è Rust-powered Logic: Core habit calculations and date rule parsing (RRULE) are handled by a Rust module compiled to WASM.
-	üß† Smart Time Logic: Accurate date and time handling using Rust‚Äôs chrono crate, including timezone support.
-	üß™ Local-first UX: User data is stored locally in the browser, with plans for optional cloud sync.
-	üé® Clean UI: Built with TailwindCSS, designed for minimal distractions and optimal usability.

### Why Rust and WebAssembly?

One of my goals was to learn Rust in a real-world context. Habit tracking requires precision in dealing with timezones, recurrence rules, and logic that benefits from performance. I used Rust to:
- Parse and calculate recurring habit schedules (like iCal-style RRULEs).
- Safely handle date-time manipulation.
- Compile to WebAssembly and seamlessly run in the browser alongside my Next.js frontend.

### UX & Design Process

As an experienced UX instructor, I took this opportunity to go deep into usability:
- Created user flows and low-fi wireframes to simplify interaction.
- Prioritized keyboard navigation and accessibility from the start.
- Performed manual and automated accessibility testing.
- Iterated on the design through self-testing and feedback loops.



### What I Learned
- Gained deep experience integrating Rust into a modern JS frontend via WASM.
- Strengthened my understanding of date-time management across locales.
- Reinforced my design thinking by wearing both developer and designer hats.
- Learned to balance minimalism with functionality through multiple iterations.
